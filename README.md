# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

## Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental differences between Java arrays and ArrayLists. It includes a code sample and detailed comments to help students understand how arrays and ArrayLists work, their respective advantages, and when to use each.

## Discussion

Arrays in Java are fixed in size and require manual resizing when more elements need to be added. They can store both primitive data types and objects. ArrayLists, on the other hand, are part of the `java.util` package, can change size dynamically, and can only store objects. The code in this project shows both structures in action and comments explain their differences and typical use cases.

See `DifferenceArraysArrayLists.java` for the main demonstration.
